.SH NAME
dh_installwm \- register a window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installwm
.I "[debhelper options] [-n] [--priority=n] [wm ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installwm is a debhelper program that is responsible for
generating the postinst and postrm commands that register a window manager
with
.BR update-alternatives (8)
.P
Any windowmanager filenames specified as parameters will be registered in
the first package dh_installwm is told to act on. By default, this is the
first binary package in debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags, it
will be the first package specified by those flags.
.P
Files named debian/package.wm can list other window managers programs to
register.
.SH OPTIONS

.B \--priority=n

most window managers; see the Debian Policy document for instructions on
calculating the correct value.

between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
