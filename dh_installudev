=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_installudev> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [B<-n>] [B<--name=>I<name>] [B<--priority=>I<priority>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_installudev is a debhelper program that is responsible for
installing udev rules files.

Files named debian/package.udev will be installed as
etc/udev/package.rules in the package build directory.

Then postinst and postrm commands are automatically generated to enable
the rules file when the package is first installed, by creating a symlink
to it in the /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory. See L<dh_installdeb(1)> for an
explanation of how this works.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-n>, B<--noscripts>

Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts.

=item B<--name=>I<name>

Use "name" as the filename the rules file is installed in
/etc/udev/. When this parameter is used, dh_installudev looks for and
installs files named debian/package.name.udev instead of the usual
debian/package.udev.

=item B<--priority=>I<priority>

Sets the priority string of the rules.d symlink. Default is z60.

=head1 NOTES

Note that this command is not idempotent. "dh_clean -k" should be called
between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

			doit("install","-d","$tmp/etc/udev");
		}
		doit("install","-m","0644",$rules_file,"$tmp/etc/udev/$filename");
