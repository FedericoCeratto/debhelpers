Debhelper v3 is a major new revision of debhelper. Currently, v3 is still
being worked on, and will change in drastic ways without notice. This
*will* break packages that use it, so don't, unless you like riding the
bleeding edge.

To enable debhelper v3 features (do this with *caution*), set DH_COMPAT=3 in
your debian/rules. Also, it is a very good idea to add a call to your
debian/rules like this:
	dh_testversion 2
To ensure that your package won't be built with some old version of
debhelper that ignores the DH_COMPAT flag.

Here are the changes I'm planning to make to debhelper for v3, based on
prior discussion on debian-devel.

Items marked with a + are done. All others will happen as soon as I can code
them.

* dh_installmanpages will be made into a non-DWIM program, so you'll have to
  specify all man pages to install and possibly where to put them. This may
  look something like:
  	dh_installmanpages -x xterm.1 xfoo.1 xbar.man
	dh_installmanpages --section=8 su.man
  Ok, there's a _little_ DWIM left in there, it'll be smart enough to munge
  the .man filenames properly. It'll probably just assume all man pages have
  an  extension, and delete that extentation, and add the correct one.

+ Every file in etc/ is automatically flagged as a conffile by dh_installdeb.

+ Debhelper config files support globbing via * and ?, when
  appropriate. To turn this off and use those characters raw, just prefix
  with a backspash.

+ dh_makeshlibs generates autoscript fragments for ldconfig. This will
  require you call it before dh_installdeb. (Many old debian/rules scripts
  call it after.)
