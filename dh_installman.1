.SH NAME
dh_installman \- install man pages into package build directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installman
.I "[debhelper options] [manpage ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installman is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
man pages into the correct locations in package build directories. You tell
it what man pages go in your package(s), and it figure out where to install
them based on the section field in their .TH line and their filename
extention.
.P
Any man page filenames specified as parameters will be installed into the
first package dh_installman is told to act on. By default, this is the
first binary package in debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags,
it will be the first package specified by those flags.
.P
Files named debian/package.manpages can list other man pages to be installed.
.P
After the man page installation step, dh_installman will check to see if
any of the man pages in the temporary directories of any of the packages it
is acting on contain ".so" links. If so, it changes them to symlinks.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B debhelper options
See
.BR debhelper (1)
for a list of options common to all debhelper commands.
.TP
.B \-A, \--all
Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL packages
acted on.
.TP

.SH NOTES
An older version of this program,
.BR dh_installmanpages (1)
, is still used by some packages, and so is still included in debhelper.
It is, however, deprecated, due to its counterintuiitive and inconsistent
interface. Use this program instead.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
See
.BR debhelper (1)
for a list of environment variables that affect all debhelper commands.

.SH BUGS
It's impossible to specify filenames with spaces or other whitespace in
them in debian/package.manpages file. This is more a historical design
flaw than a bug.
