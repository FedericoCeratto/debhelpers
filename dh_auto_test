=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_auto_test> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [S<B<--> I<params>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_auto_test is a debhelper program that tries to automatically run a
package's test suite. If there's a Makefile and it contains a "test"
or "check" target, then this is  done by running make (or MAKE, if the
environment variable is set). If the test suite fails, the command will
exit nonzero. If there's no test suite, it will exit zero without doing
anything.

This is intended to work for about 90% of packages with a test suite. If it
doesn't work, you're encoruaged to skip using dh_auto_test at all, and
just run the test suite manually.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--> I<params>

or override the any standard parameters that dh_auto_test passes.
