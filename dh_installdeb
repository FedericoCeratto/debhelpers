=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_installdeb> [S<I<debhelper options>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_installdeb is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
files into the DEBIAN directories in package build directories with the
correct permissions.

dh_installdeb automatically installs the following files from debian/ into
the DEBIAN directory:
  package.postinst
  package.preinst
  package.postrm
  package.prerm
  package.shlibs
  package.conffiles
  package.triggers

The postinst, preinst, postrm, and prerm are handled specially: If a
corresponding file named debian/package.script.debhelper exists, the contents
of that file are merged into the script as follows: If the script exists,
then anywhere in it that "#DEBHELPER#" appears, the text of the .debhelper
file is inserted. If the script does not exist, then a script is generated
from the .debhelper file. The .debhelper files are created by other debhelper
programs, such as L<dh_installmenu(1)>, and are shell script fragments.

In V3 compatibility mode and higher, all files in the etc/ directory in a
package will automatically be flagged as conffiles by this program, so
there is no need to list them manually in package.conffiles.
