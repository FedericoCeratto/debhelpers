=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_auto_clean> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [S<I<dh_auto options>>] [S<B<--> I<params>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_auto_clean is a debhelper program that is responsible for the I<clean> step
of the L<dh_auto(7)> building process. It tries to automatically clean up after
a package build by removing all temporary files from the build directory or
even the build directory itself as appropriate. dh_auto_clean will fail only if
the source build system clean routine fails. However, if the latter does not
exist or there is nothing to clean it will exit with zero status doing nothing.

If dh_auto_clean does not meet your needs or does not work, it is safe to
skip/override it entirely and just run clean up manually.
