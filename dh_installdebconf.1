.SH NAME
dh_installdebconf \- install debconf files into package build directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installdebconf
.I "[debhelper options] [-n]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installdebconf is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
files used by the debconf package into package build directories.
.P
It also automatically generates the postrm commands needed to 
interface with debconf. See 
.BR dh_installdeb (1)
for an explanation of how this works.
.P
Files named debian/package.config and debian/package.templates are installed
into the DEBIAN directory in the package build directory.
.P
For the first first binary package listed in the control file, you may use
debian/config and debian/templates instead.
.P
Note that if you use debconf, your package probably needs to depend on it.
.SH "LOCALIZED TEMPLATE FILES"
Debconf also supports localized template files, and this program has some
support to aid working with them. You may find it easiest to keep the
translations in separate files, and merge them only at build time. See
.BR debconf-mergetemplate (1)
for details.
.P
This program will automatically call 
.BR debconf-mergetemplate (1)
and merge templates on the fly if it finds your template files are accompnied
by translated files that have the same name as the template file, with a
dot and two letters prepended.
.P
For example, if you have a German translation,
debian/templates.de is merged with debian/templates.
.P
If you use this feature, your package should build-depend on debconf-utils.
