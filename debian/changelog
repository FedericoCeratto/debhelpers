debhelper (4.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles has long been a sore point in debhelper. Inherited
    from debstd, its interface and implementation suck, and I have maintained
    it while never really deigning to use it. Now there is a remplacment:
    dh_install, which ...
    - copies files, doesn't move them. Closes: #75360, #82649
    - doesn't have that whole annoying debian/package.files vs. debian/files
      mess, as it uses debian/install.
    - supports copying empty subdirs. Closes: #133037
    - doesn't use tar, thus no error reproting problems. Closes: #112538
    - files are listed relative to the pwd, debian/tmp need not be used at
      all, so no globbing issues. Closes: #100404
    - supports -X. Closes: #116902
    - the whole concept of moving files out of a directory is gone, so this
      bug doesn't really apply. Closes: #120026
    - This is exactly what Bill Allombert asked for in #117383, even though I
      designed it seemingly independantly. Thank you Bill! Closes: #117383
  * Made debhelper's debian/rules a lot simpler by means of the above.
  * Updated example rules file to use dh_install. Also some reordering and
    other minor changes.
  * dh_movefiles is lightly deprecated, and when you run into its bugs and
    bad design, you are incouraged to just use dh_install instead.
  * dh_fixperms: in v4 only, make all files in bin/ dirs +x. Closes: #119039
  * dh_fixperms: in v4 only, make all files in etc/init.d executable (of
    course there's -X ..)    
  * dh_link: in v4 only, finds existing, non-policy-conformant symlinks
    and corrects them. This has the side effect of making dh_link idempotent.
  * Added a -h/--help option. This seems very obvious, but it never occured to
    me before..
  * use v4 for building debhelper itself
  * v4 mode is done, you may now use it without fear of it changing.
    (This idea of this upload is to get v4 into woody so people won't run into
    many issues backporting from sarge to woody later on. Packages targeted
    for woody should continue to use whatever compatability level they are
    using.)

debhelper (3.4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to Benjamin Drieu <benj@debian.org>, dh_installdocs -X now works.
    I had to modify his patch to use cp --parents, since -P spews warnings
    now. Also, I made it continue to use cp -a if nothing is excluded,
    which is both faster, and means this patch is less likely to break
    anything if it turns out to be buggy. Also, stylistic changes.

debhelper (3.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced the debian/compat file. This is the new, preferred way to say
    what debhelper compatability level your package uses. It has the big
    advantage of being available to debhelper when you run it at the command
    line, as well as in debian/rules.
  * A new v4 feature: dh_installinit, in v4 mode, will use invoke-rc.d.
    This is in v4 for testing, but I may well roll it back into v3 (and
    earlier) once woody is released and I don't have to worry about breaking
    things (and, presumably, once invoke-rc.d enters policy).
  * Some debhelper commands will now build up a new substvars variable,
    ${misc:Depends}, based on things they know your package needs to depend
    on. For example, dh_installinit in v4 mode adds sysvinit (>= 2.80-1) to
    that dep list, and dh_installxfonts adds a dep on xutils. This variable
    should make it easier to keep track of what your package needs to depends
    on, supplimenting the ${shlibs:Depends} and ${perl:Depends} substvars.
    Hmm, this appears to be based loosely on an idea by Masato Taruishi
    <taru@debian.org>, filtered through a long period of mulling it over.
    Closes: #76352
  * Use the addsubstvar function I wrote for the above in dh_perl too.

debhelper (3.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Began work on v4 support (and thus the large version number jump), and it
    is only for the very brave right now since I will unhesitatingly break
    compatability in v4 mode as I'm developing it. Currently, updating to v4
    mode will only make dh_makeshlibs -V generate shared library deps that
    omit the debian part of the version number. The reasoning behind this
    change is that the debian revision should not typically break binary
    compatability, that existing use of -V is causing too tight versioned
    deps, and that if you do need to include the debian revision for some
    reason, you can always write it out by hand. Closes: #101497
  * dh_testversion is deprecated -- use build deps instead. A warning message
    is now output when it runs. Currently used by: 381 packages.
  * dh_installxaw is deprecated -- xaw-wrappers in no longer in the
    distribution. A warning message is now output when it runs. Currently used
    by: 3 packages (bugs filed).
  * Added referneces to menufile in dh_installmenu man page. Closes: #127978
    (dh_make is not a part of debhelper, if you want it changed, file a bug on
    dh-make.)

    (Those files used to be used by debhelper for automatically generated
    data, but it uses a different internal filename now). It will be merged
    with any automatically determined substvars data. See bug #98819
  * I want to stress that no one should ever rely in internal, undocumented
    debhelper workings. Just because debhelper uses a certian name for some
    internally used file does not mean that you should feel free to modify
    that file to your own ends in a debian package. If you do use it, don't
    be at all suprised when it breaks. If you find that debhelper is lacking
    a documented interface for something that you need, ask for it!

debhelper (3.0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed issues with extended parameters to dh_gencontrol including spaces
    and quotes. This was some histirical cruft that deals with splitting up
    the string specified by -u, and it should not have applied to the set
    of options after --. Now that it's fixed, any and all programs that
    support a -- and options after it, do not require any special quoting
    of the succeeding options. Quote just like you would in whatever
    program those options go to. So, for example, 
    dh_gencontrol -Vblah:Depends='foo, bar (>= 1.2)' will work just as you
    would hope. This fix does NOT apply to -u; don't use -u if you must do
    something complex. Closes: #89311

  * Updated dh_perl to a new version for the new perl organization and
    policy. The -k flag has been done away with, as the new perl packages

debhelper (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installman, a new program that replaces dh_installmanpages.
    It is not DWIM. You tell it what to install and it figures out where 
    based on .TH section field and filename extention. I reccommend everyone
    begin using it, since this is much better then dh_installmanpages's
    evilness. I've been meaning to do this for a very long time..
    Closes: #38673, #53964, #64297, #16933, #17061, #54059, #54373, #61816
  * dh_installmanpages remains in the package for backwards compatability,
    but is mildly deprecated.
  * dh_testversion is deprecated; use build dependancies instead.
  * dh_suidregister: re-enabled. Aj thinks that requiring people to stop
    using it is unacceptable. Who am I to disagree with a rc bug report?
    Closes: #84910 It is still deprecated, and it will still whine at you
    if you use it. I appreciate the job everyone has been doing at
    switching to statoverrides..
  * Since dh_debstd requires dh_installmanpages (where do you think the
    latter's evil interface came from?), I have removed it. It was a nice
    thought-toy, but nobody really used it, right?
  * Since the from-debstd document walks the maintainer through running
    dh_debstd to get a list of debhelper commands, and since that document
    has really outlives its usefullness, I removed it too. Use dh-make
    instead.
  * dh_installman installs only into /usr/share/man, not the X11R6
    directory. Policy says "files must not be installed into
    `/usr/X11R6/bin/', `/usr/X11R6/lib/', or `/usr/X11R6/man/' unless this
    is necessary for the package to operate properly", and I really doubt
    a man page being in /usr/share/man is going to break many programs.
    Closes: #81853 (I hope the bug submitter doesn't care that
    dh_installmanpages still puts stuff in the X11R6/man directory.)
  * dh_undocumented now the same too now.
  * dh_installinit: installs debian/package.default files as /etc/default/
    files.
  * Updated to current perl coding standards (use strict, lower-case
    variable names, pod man pages).
  * Since with the fixing of the man page installer issue, my checklist for
    debhelper v3 is complete, I pronounce debhelper v3 done! Revved the
    version number appropriatly (a large jump; v3 changes less than I had
    planned). Note that I have no plans for a v4 at this time. :-)
  * Testing: I have used this new version of debhelper to build a large
    number of my own packages, and it seems to work. But this release
    touches every file in this package, so be careful out there..

  * suidmanager is obsolete now, and so is dh_suidmanager. Instead,
    packages that contain suid binaries should include the binaries suid in
    the .deb, and dpkg-statoverride can override this. If this is done
    to a program that previously used suidmanager, though, you need to
    conflict with suidmanager (<< 0.50).
  * Made dh_suidmanager check to see if it would have done anything before.
    If so, it states that it is obsolete, and refer users to the man
    page, which now explains the situation, and then aborts the build.
    If it would have done nothing before, it just outputs a warning that
    it is an obsolete program.

    - dh_makeshlibs makes the postinst/postrm call ldconfig. Closes: #77154
      Patch from Masato Taruishi <taru@debian.org> (modified). If you 
      use this, be sure dh_makeshlibs runs before dh_installdeb; many
      old rules files have the ordering backwards.
    - dh_installdeb now causes all files in /etc to be registered as
      conffiles.
    - debian/README is now supported: it is treated exactly like
      debian/README.Debian. Either file is installed as README.Debian in
      non-native packages, and now as just README in native packages.
      Closes: #34628
  * This is really only the start of the changes for v3, so use with
    caution..
  * dh_du has finally been removed. It has been deprecated for ages, and
    a grep of the archive shows that nothing is using it except biss-awt

  * dh_movefiles: no longer does the symlink ordering hack, as
    this is supported by dpkg itself now. Added a dependancy on
    dpkg-dev >= 1.7.0 to make sure this doesn't break anything.
  * While I'm updating for dpkg 1.7.0, I removed the -ldirectory hack
    from dh_shlibdeps; dpkg-shlibdeps has its own much more brutal hack to
    make this work. The switch is ignored now for backwards compatability.

debhelper (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * I started work on debhelper v2 over a year ago, with a long list of
    changes I hoped to get in that broke backwards compatability. That
    development stalled after only the most important change was made,
    although I did get out over 100 releases in the debhelper 2.0.x tree.
    In the meantime, lots of packages have switched to using v2, despite my
    warnings that doing so leaves packages open to being broken without
    notice until v2 is complete.
  * Therefore, I am calling v2 complete, as it is. Future non-compatabile
    changes will happen in v3, which will be started soon. This means that
    by using debhelper v2, one major thing changes: debhelper uses
    debian/<package> as the temporary directory for *all* packages;
    debian/tmp is no longer used to build binary packages out of. This is
    very useful for multi-binary packages, and I reccommend everyone
    switch to v2.
  * Updated example rules files to use v2 by default.
  * Updated all documentation to assume that v2 is being used.
  * Added a few notes for people still using v1.
  * Moved all of the README into debhelper(1).

  * Patch from Jorgen `forcer' Schaefer <forcer at mindless.com> (much
    modified)to make dh_installwm use new window manager registration method,
    update-alternatives. Closes: #52156, #34684 (latter bug is obsolete)
  * Fixed $dh{flavor} to be upper-case.
  * Deprecated dh_installemavcsen --number; use --priority instead. Also,
    the option parser requires the parameter be a number now. And,
    dh_installwm now accepts --priority, and window manager packages should
    start using it.
  * dh_installwm now behaves like a proper debhelper command, and reads
    debian/<package>.wm too. This is a small behavior change; filenames
    specified on the command line no longer apply to all packages it acts
    on. I can't belive this program existed for 2 years with such a glaring
    problem; I guess most people don't need ot register 5 wm's in 3
    sub-packages. Anyway, it can handle such things now. :-)
  * Moved Dh_*.pm to /usr/lib/perl5/Debian/Debhelper. *big* change.

    link, and then removing its suid bit. This messed up the registration
    of the other had links, since their permissions were now changed,
    leading to unpredictable results. The fix is to just not remove suid
    bits until all files have been registered.

    (Closes: #51099)
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: Modified it so any options specified after -- are added to

  * Added new dh_installxfonts script by Changwoo Ryu
    <cwryu@dor17988.kaist.ac.kr>. Closes: #46684
    I made some changes, though:
    - I rewrote lots of this script to be more my style of perl.
    - I removed all the verbisity from the postinst script fragment, since
      that is a clear violation of policy.
    - I made the postinst fail if the mkfontdir, etc commands fail, because
      this really makes more sense. Consider idempotency.
    - I moved the test to see if the font dir is really a directory into the
      dh_ script and out of the snippet. If the maintainer plays tricks on
      us, mkfontdir will blow up satisfactorally anyway.
    - So, the snippet is 9 lines long now, down from 20-some.
    - I realize this isn't following the reccommendations made in Brando^Hen's
      font policy. I'll fight it out with him. :-)
    - In postrm fragment, used rmdir -p to remove as many parent directories
      as I can.

    dh_installmanpages needed a non-obvious change though.
  * Closes: #42489, #42587, #41732.
  * dh_installdocs: Adds code to postinst and prerm as specified in
    http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-ctte-9908/msg00038.html,
    to make /usr/doc/<package> a compatability symlink to
    /usr/share/doc/<package>. Note that currently if something exists in
    /usr/doc/<package> when the postinst is run, it will silently not make
    the symlink. I'm considering more intellingent handing of this case.
  * Note that if you build a package with this version of debhelper, it will
    use /usr/share/man, /usr/share/doc, and /usr/share/info. You may need to
    modify other files in your package that reference the old locations.

  * debhelper.1: mentioned above technique.

    building of single binary packages independntly, via binary-<package>
    targets. It accomplishes all this using only one list of debhelper

debhelper (2.0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Wow. It turns out dh_installdocs has been doing it wrong and doc-base
    files have the doc-id inside them. Applied and modified a patch from
    Peter Moulder <reiter@netspace.net.au> to make it use those id's instead
    of coming up with it's own. (Closes: #42650)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Aug 1999 10:24:10 -0700

debhelper (2.0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_perl: Patch from Raphael Hertzog <rhertzog@hrnet.fr> to allow
    specification on the command line of alternate paths to search for perl
    modules. (Closes: #42171)

debhelper (2.0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinfo: fixed bug if a info file had no section.

debhelper (2.0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installxaw: fixed multiple stanza problem, for real this time (patch
    misapplied last time). (Closes: #41862)

debhelper (2.0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: compat() wasn't exported.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Jul 1999 12:49:52 -0700

debhelper (2.0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dh_lib.pm: when looking for debhelper files in debian/, test with -f,
    not with -e, because it might fail if you're building a package named,
    say, 'docs', with a temp dir of debian/docs. I don't anticipate this
    ever happenning, but it pays to be safe.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Jul 1999 21:00:04 -0700

debhelper (2.0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: only force-remove debian/tmp if in v2 mode. In v1 mode, we
    shouldn't remove it because we may only be acting on a single package.
    (Closes: #41689)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Jul 1999 19:00:15 -0700

debhelper (2.0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved /usr/lib/debhelper to /usr/share/debhelper for FHS compliance
    (#41174). If you used Dh_lib or something in another package, be sure to
    update your "use" line and declare an appropriate dependancy. (Closes:
    #41174)
  * dh_installxaw: Patch from Josip Rodin <joy@cibalia.gkvk.hr> to fix
    multiple-stanza xaw file support. (Closes: #41173)

debhelper (2.0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinfo: fixed #SECTION# substitution.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jul 1999 17:51:59 -0700

debhelper (2.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * At long, long last, dh_installinfo is written. It takes a simple list of
    info files and figures out the rest for you. (Closes: #15717)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jul 1999 17:04:48 -0700

debhelper (2.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: compress changelog.html files. (Closes: #40626)
  * dh_installchangelogs: installs a link from changelog.html.gz to changelog.gz, 
    because I think it's important that upstream changelogs always be accessable
    at that name.
  * dh_compress: removed the usr/share/X11R6/man bit. Note part of FHS.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jul 1999 10:46:03 -0700

debhelper (2.0.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: added some FHS support. Though debhelper doesn't put stuff
    there (and won't until people come up with a general transition strategy or
    decide to not have a clean transiotion), dh_compress now compresses
    various files in /usr/share/{man,doc,info}. (Closes: #40892)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jul 1999 09:55:03 -0700

debhelper (2.0.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_*: redirect cd output to /den/null, because CD can actually output
    things if CDPATH is set.

debhelper (2.0.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_perl calls to example rules files.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Jul 1999 15:57:51 -0700

debhelper (2.0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now depends on perl5 | perl, I'll kill the | perl bit later on, but it
    seems to make sense for the transition.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Jul 1999 10:56:03 -0700

debhelper (2.0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: clean debian/tmp even if v2 is being used. If you're
    using dh_movefiles, stuff may well be left in there, and it needs to be
    cleaned up.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jul 1999 13:23:46 -0700

debhelper (2.0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Raphael Hertzog <rhertzog@hrnet.fr> to make dh_perl support a
    -d flag that makes it add a dependancy on the sppropriate perl-XXX-base
    package. Few packages will really need this. (Closes: #40631)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Jul 1999 11:22:00 -0700

debhelper (2.0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on file >= 2.23-1, because dh_perl uses file -b, introduced at
    that version. (Closes: #40589)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 14:41:12 -0700

debhelper (2.0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * If you're going to use v2, it's reccommended you call 
    "dh_testversion 2". Added a note about that to doc/v2.
  * Dh_Lib.pm compat: if a version that is greater than the highest
    supported compatability level is specified, abort with an error. Perhaps
    there will be a debhelper v3 some day...

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 14:08:14 -0700

debhelper (2.0.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Actually include doc/v2 this time round.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 14:01:55 -0700

debhelper (2.0.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't let the version number fool you. Debhelper v2 is here, but just
    barely. That's what all the zero's mean. :-)
  * If DH_COMPAT=2, then debian/<package> will be used for the temporary
    build directory for all packages. debian/tmp is no more! (Well, except
    dh_movefiles still uses it.)
  * debhelper.1: documented this. 
  * Dh_lib.pm: added compat(), pass in a number, it returns true if the
    current compatability level is equal to that number.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: documented that.
  * debhelper itself now builds using DH_COMPAT=2.
  * dh_debstd forces DH_COMPAT=1, because it needs to stay compatable with
    debstd after all.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 13:37:58 -0700

debhelper (1.9.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a release of debhelper in preparation for debhelper v2.
  * doc/v2: added, documented status of v2 changes.
  * README: mention doc/v2
  * debhelper.1: docuimented DH_COMPAT
  * examples/*: added DH_COMAPT=1 to top of rules files

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 13:16:41 -0700

debhelper (1.2.83) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_perl: fixed substvars typo. Urgency medium since a lot of people will
    be using this script RSN.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 11:44:05 -0700

debhelper (1.2.82) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinit: applied patch from Yann Dirson <ydirson@multimania.com>
    to make it look for init.d scripts matching the --init-script parameter.
    This is only useful if, like Yann, you have packages that need to install
    more than 1 init script.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jun 1999 11:38:05 -0700

debhelper (1.2.81) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_link: fixed bug #40159 and added a regression test for it. It was
    failing if it was given absolute filenames.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jun 1999 10:12:44 -0700

debhelper (1.2.80) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed perl version detection.
  * Changed call to find.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jun 1999 16:48:53 -0700

debhelper (1.2.79) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_perl by Raphael Hertzog <rhertzog@hrnet.fr>. dh_perl handles
    finding dependancies of perl scripts, plus deleting those annoying
    .packlist files.
  * I don't think dh_perl is going to be useful until the new version of
    perl comes out.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jun 1999 14:47:55 -0700

debhelper (1.2.78) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really include dh_installpam.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Jun 1999 09:00:36 -0700

debhelper (1.2.77) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installpam: new program by Sean <shaleh@foo.livenet.net>
  * Wrote man page for same.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Jun 1999 13:08:04 -0700

debhelper (1.2.76) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: Do not use chmod/chown -R at all anymore, instead it uses
    the (slower) find then chown method. Necessary because the -R methods will
    happyily attempt to chown a dangling symlink, which makes them fail.
    (Closes: #38911)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jun 1999 20:20:01 -0700

debhelper (1.2.75) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installemacsen: fixed perms of install, remove scripts.
    (closes: #39082)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jun 1999 14:42:12 -0700

debhelper (1.2.74) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: recognizes gzipped man pages and installs them.
    This is an experimental change, one problem is if your man page isn't
    already gzip-9'd, it will be in violation of policy. (closes: #38673)
  * The previous fix to dh_installemacsen was actually quite necessary - the
    x bit was being set!

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jun 1999 15:14:27 -0700

debhelper (1.2.73) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installemacsen: make sure files are installed mode 0644. Not strictly
    necessary since dh_fixperms fixes them if you have a wacky umask, but oh
    well. (Closes: 38900)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jun 1999 14:50:42 -0700

debhelper (1.2.72) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installemacsen: use debian/package.emacsen-startup, not
    debian/package.emacsen-init. The former has always been documented to
    work on the man page (closes: #38898).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jun 1999 14:16:57 -0700

debhelper (1.2.71) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a typo (closes: #38881)

debhelper (1.2.70) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: Properly quoted metacharacters in $dir in regexp.

debhelper (1.2.69) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't include Test.pm in the binary package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 23 May 1999 19:29:27 -0700

debhelper (1.2.68) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/README: updated example of using #DEBHELPER# in a perl script, with
    help from Julian Gilbey.
  * dh_link: generate absolute symlinks where appropriate. The links
    generated before were wrong simetimes (#37774)
  * Started writing a regression test suite for debhelper. Currently covers
    only the above bugfix and a few more dh_link tests.
  * Tossed Test.pm into the package (for regression tests) until we get perl
    5.005 which contains that package. That file is licenced the same as perl.
  * dh_installchangelogs: force all installed files to be owned by root
    (#37655).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 16 May 1999 17:18:44 -0700

debhelper (1.2.67) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmodules: fixed type that made the program not work.

debhelper (1.2.64) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmime: new command (#37093, #32684).

debhelper (1.2.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installxaw: updated to work with xaw-wrappers 0.90 and above. It
    actually has to partially parse the xaw-wrappers config files now. 

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  2 May 1999 19:13:34 -0700

debhelper (1.2.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installemacsen: added support for site-start files. Added --flavor
    and --number to control details of installation. (#36832)

debhelper (1.2.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums.1: dh_md5sums is not deprecated, AFAIK, but the manpage has
    somehow been modified to say it was at version 1.2.45.

debhelper (1.2.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installexamples.1: recycled docs fix.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Apr 1999 17:19:07 -0700

debhelper (1.2.59) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_builddeb: added --destdir option, which lets you tell it where
    to put the generated .deb's. Default is .. of course.

debhelper (1.2.57) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (1.2.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_suidregister: make the chown/chmod only happen if the file actually
    exists. This is useful if you have conffiles that have permissions and
    may be deleted. (#35845)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Apr 1999 13:35:23 -0700

debhelper (1.2.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * Various man page enhancements.
  * dh_md5sums: supports -X to make it skip including files in the
    md5sums (#35819).

debhelper (1.2.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinit.1: man page fixups (#34160).
  * *.1: the date of each man page is now automatically updated when 
    debhelper is built to be the last modification time of the man page.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Apr 1999 20:28:00 -0700

debhelper (1.2.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: leave .taz and .tgz files alone. Previously trying to
    compress such files caused gzip to fail and the whole command to fail.
    Probably fixes #35677. Actually, it now skips files with a whole
    range of odd suffixes that gzip refuses to compress, including "_z" and
    "-gz".
  * dh_compress.1: updated docs to reflect this, and to give the new
    suggested starting point if you want to write your own debian/compress
    file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Apr 1999 02:20:14 -0700

debhelper (1.2.52) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (1.2.51) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (1.2.49) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: if called with -X, was attempting to change permissions of
    even symlinks. This could have even caused it to follow the symlinks and
    modify files on the build system in some cases. Ignores them now. (#35102)

debhelper (1.2.48) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (1.2.47) unstable; urgency=low

    fragments inside a perl program -- the old method didn't work with shell

debhelper (1.2.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress.1: man page fixes (Closes: #33858).
  * dh_compress: now it can handle compressing arbitrary numbers of files,
    spawning gzip multiple times like xargs does, if necessary.
    (Closes: #33860)
  * Dh_Lib.pm: added xargs() command.

debhelper (1.2.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * autoscripts/*menu*: It turns out that "command" is like test -w, it will
    still return true if update-menus is not executable. This can
    legitimatly happen if you are upgrading the menu package, and it makes
    postinsts that use command fail. Reverted to using test -x. Packages
    built with debhelper >= 1.2.21 that use menus should be rebuilt.

debhelper (1.2.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: linux 2.1.x and 2.2.x differ from earlier versions in that
    they do not clear the suid bit on a file when the owner of that file
    changes. It seems that fakeroot behaves the same as linux 2.1 here. I
    was relying on the old behavior to get rid of suid and sgid bits on files.
    Since this no longer happens implicitly, I've changed to clearing the
    bits explicitly.
  * There's also a small behavior change involved here. Before, dh_fixperms
    did not clear suid permissions on files that were already owned by root.
    Now it does.
  * dh_fixperms.1: cleaned up the docs to mention that those bits are
    cleared.

debhelper (1.2.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Added doc-base support, if debian/<package>.doc-base
    exists, it will be installed as a doc-base control file. If you use this,
    you probably want to add "dh_testversion 1.2.21" to the rules file to make
    sure your package is built with a new enough debhelper.
  * dh_installdocs: now supports -n to make it not modify postinst/prerm.
  * dh_suidregister: turned off leading 0/1 in permissions settings, until
    suidregister actually supports it.
  * autoscripts/*: instead of "text -x", use "command -v" to see if various
    binaries exist. This gets rid of lots of hard-coded paths.

debhelper (1.2.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_listpackages: new command. Takes the standard options taken by other
    debhelper commands, and just outputs a list of the binary packages a
    debhelper command would act on. Added because of bug #30626, and because
    of wn's truely ugly use of debhelper internals to get the same info (and
    because it's just 4 lines of code ;-).
  * dh_compress: is now smart about compressing files that are hardlinks.
    When possible, will only compress one file, delete the hardlinks, and
    re-make hardlinks to the compressed file, saving some disk space.

    it will work on libraries with a major but no minor version in their

  * dh_installdocs: behavior change: all docs are now installed mode 644.
    I have looked and it doesn't seem this will actually affect any packages
    in debian. This is useful only if you want to use dh_installdocs and not
    dh_fixperms, and that's the only time this behavior change will have any
    effect, either. (#30118)

    reason is this: if you're using suidmanager, and you want a file that
    ships suid to never be suid on your system, shipping it suid in the .deb
    will create a window where it is suid before suidmanager fixes it's
    permissions. This change should be transparent to users and developers.

  * dh_fixperms: quoting fix from Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org>
  * Added support for register-window-manager command which will be in a new
    (as yet unreleased) xbase. Now a new dh_installwm program handles
    registration of a window manager and the necessary modifications to
    postinst and postrm. It's safe to go ahead and start using this for your
    window manager packages, just note that it won't do anything until the new
    xbase is out, and that due to the design of register-window-manager, if
    your wm is installed before a xbase that supports register-window-manager
    is installed, the window manager will never be registered. (#20971)

    a package that builds only for 1 architecture, as part of a multi-part,

  * Modified dh_installinit -r so it does start the daemon on the initial

debhelper (1.1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: on Richard Braakman's advice, strip the .comment and .note
    sections of shared libraries.
  * Added DH_OPTIONS environment variable - anything in it will be treated
    as additional command line arguments by all debhelper commands. This in
    useful in some situations, for example, if you need to pass -p to all
    debhelper commands that will be run. If you use DH_OPTIONS, be sure to
    use dh_testversion 1.1.17 - older debhelpers will ignore it and do
    things you don't want them to.
  * Made -N properly exclude packages when no -i, -a, or -p flags are
    present. It didn't before, which was a bug.

  * Debhelper now has a web page at http://kitenet.net/programs/debhelper/

  * dh_compress: since version 0.88 or so, dh_compress has bombed out if
    a debian/compress file returned an error code. This was actually
    unintentional - in fact, the debian/compress example in the man page
    will fail this way if usr/info or usr/X11R6 is not present. Corrected
    the program to not fail. (#26214)

debhelper (1.1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: forgot to pass package name to isnative(). Any native
    debian package that had a debian/TODO would have it installed with the

debhelper (1.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * It's come to my attention that a few packages use filename globbing in
    debian/{docs,examples,whatever} files and expect that to work. It used
    to work before the perl conversion, but it was never _documented_, or
    intented to work. If you use this in your packages, they are broken and
    need fixing (and will refuse to build with current versions of debhelper).
    I apologize for the inconvenience.

  * dh_clean: fixed a bug, intorduced in version 1.1.8, where it didn't
    remove debian/files properly.
  * dh_shlibdeps, dh_testdir, dh_testroot, dh_testversion: converted to perl.
  * Encode the version of debhelper in a sepererate file, so dh_testversion

  * dh_installdirs: now you can use absolute directory names too if you
    prefer.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: updated to cover new perl modules.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: doit(): when printing out commands that have run, escape
    metacharacters in the output. I probably don't escape out all the
    characters I should, but this is just a convenience to the user anyway.
  * dh_installdebfiles: it's been broken forever, I fixed it. Obviously
    nobody uses it anymore, which is good, since it's deprected :-)

  * dh_installdocs: was only operating on the first package.
  * dh_installexamples: rewritten in perl.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: all multiple package operations were broken.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: implemented complex_doit() and autoscript().
  * Made all perl code work with use strict and -w (well, except
    dh_getopt.pl, but that's a hack that'll go away one day).
  * I didn't realize, but rewriting dh_installdocs in perl fixed bug #24686
    (blank lines in debian/docs file problem), although this same problem 
    applies to other debhelper programs... like dh_installexamples, which had
    the same bug fixed when I rewrote it in perl just now.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: accidentially didn't check DH_VERBOSE if commands were not
    passed any switches.
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: --noscripts was broken.

  * Added Dh_Lib.pm, a translation of dh_lib into perl.
  * dh_getopt.pl: moved most of it into new Dh_Getopt.pm module, rewriting
    large chunks in the process.
  * dh_installdocs: completly rewritten in perl. Now it's faster and it can
    install many oddly named files it died on before.
  * dh_installdocs: fixed a bug that installed TODO files mode 655 in native
    debian packages.

    updating 27 man pages.
  * dh_*.1: updated all debheper man pages to refer to debhelper(1) where
    appropriate. Also corrected a host of little errors.

  * 1.0 at last!
  
  * This relelase is not really intended for stable. I throw a copy into
    stable-updates because I want it to be available as an upgrade for
    people using debian 2.0 (the current version in debian 2.0 has no
    critical bugs, but this version is of course a lot nicer), and I plan
    to start work on a new branch of debhelper that will fix many wishlist
    bug reports, and of course introduce many new bugs, and which will go
    into unstable only.

debhelper (0.99.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: Fixed a over-eager sanity check introduced in the last
    version.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Aug 1998 18:31:45 -0700

debhelper (0.99.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: allow passing of files to move on the command line. Only
    rarely does this make sense. (#25197)

debhelper (0.99.1) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.99) unstable; urgency=low

  * !!!! WARNING: Debhelper (specifically dh_compress) is broken with
    !!!! libtricks. Use fakeroot instead until this is fixed.
  * dh_compress: applied patch from Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    to make it not fail if there are no candidates for compression (#24654).
  * Removed a whole debhelper-0.96 tree that had crept into the source
    package by accident.
  * Is version 1.0 next?

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jul 1998 10:03:21 -0700

debhelper (0.98) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: isnative: pass -l<changelog> to dpkg-parsechangelog, to support
    odd packages with multiple different debian changelogs.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: cleaned up the docs on DH_EXCLUDE_FIND.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Jul 1998 12:45:13 -0700

debhelper (0.97) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/from-debstd: fixed a typo.
  * examples/*: install-stamp no longer depends on phony build targey; now 
    install-stamp depends on build-stamp instead (#24234).
  * dh_fixperms: applied patch from Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    to fix bad uses of the find command, so it should now work on packages 
    with files with spaces in them (#22005). It's also much cleaner. Thanks,
    Herbert!
  * dh_getopt.pl, doc/PROGRAMMING: added DH_EXCLUDE_FIND, to make the above
    fix work.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Jul 1998 18:09:25 -0700

debhelper (0.96) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: fixed serious breakage introduced in the last version.
  * dh_movefiles: really order all symlinks last.
  * some minor reorganization of the source tree.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Jun 1998 21:53:45 -0700

debhelper (0.95) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: move even very strangly named files. (#23775) Unfortunatly,
    I had to use a temporary file. Oh well..

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Jun 1998 17:16:17 -0700

debhelper (0.94) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: fixed so it handles spaces and other odd characters in 
    filenames correctly. (#23046, #23700, #22010)
  * As a side effect, got rid of the nasty temporary file dh_md5sums used
    before.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Jun 1998 16:14:42 -0700

debhelper (0.93) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on file, since several dh_*'s use it.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jun 1998 21:43:51 -0700

debhelper (0.92) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_gencontrol: pass -isp to dpkg-gencontrol to make it include section
    and priority info in the .deb file. Back in Jan 1998, this came up, and
    a consensus was reached on debian-devel that it was a good thing for
    -isp to be used.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jun 1998 16:15:24 -0700

debhelper (0.91) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: support debian/<package>.{README.Debian,TODO}

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Jun 1998 19:09:35 -0700

debhelper (0.90) unstable; urgency=low

  * I'd like to thank Len Pikulski and Igor Grobman at nothinbut.net for
    providing me with free internet access on a moment's notice, so I could
    get this package to you after hacking on it all over New England for the
    past week. Thanks, guys!
  .
  * Added dh_debstd, which mimics the functionality of the debstd command.
    It's not a complete nor an exact copy, and it's not so much intended to
    be used in a debian/rules file, as it is to be run by hand when you are
    converting a package from debstd to debhelper. "dh_debstd -v" will
    output the sequence of debhelper commands that approximate what debstd
    would do in the same situation.
  * dh_debstd is completly untested, I don't have the source to any packages
    that use debstd available. Once this is tested, I plan to release 
    debhelper 1.0!
  * Added a from-debstd document that gives a recipe to convert from debstd
    to debhelper.
  * dh_fixperms: can now use -X to exclude files from having their
    permissions changed.
  * dh_testroot: test for uid == 0, instead of username == root, becuase
    some people enjoy changing root's name.
  * dh_installinit: handle debian/init.d as well as debian/init files, 
    for backwards compatability with debstd. Unlike with debstd, the two
    files are treated identically.
  * dh_lib, PROGRAMMING: added "warning" function.
  * Minor man page fixes.
  * dh_compress: don't bomb out if usr/doc/<package> is empty. (#23054)
  * dh_compress, dh_installdirs: always cd into $TMP and back out, even if
    --no-act is on. (#23054)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Jun 1998 21:57:45 -0400

debhelper (0.88) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had many hours on a train to hack on debhelper... enjoy!
  * dh_compress: always pass -f to gzip, to force compression.
  * dh_compress: added -X switch, to make it easy to specify files to
    exclude, without all the bother of a debian/compress script. You can
    use -X multiple times, too.
  * PROGRAMMING, dh_getopt.pl: DH_EXCLUDE is now a variable set by the
    --exclude (-X) switch. -x now sets DH_INCLUDE_CONFFILES.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 17 May 1998 11:26:09 -0700

debhelper (0.87) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: strip .comment and .note, not comment and note, when stripping
    elf binaries. This makes for smaller output files. This has always been
    broken in debhelper before! (#22395)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 13 May 1998 11:54:29 -0700

debhelper (0.86) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: don't try to re-compress *.gz files. Eliminates warning
    messages in some cases, shouldn't actually change the result at all.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Apr 1998 15:21:33 -0700

debhelper (0.85) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved a few things around that were broken by Che's patch:
    - dh_installdirs should go in install target.
    - dh_clean should not run in binary targets.
  * This is just a quick fix to make it work, I'm not happy with it. I'm
    going to discuss my problems with it with Che, and either make a new
    version fixing them, or revert to 0.83.
  * So be warned that the example rules files are not currently in good
    shape if you're starting a new package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Apr 1998 23:30:38 -0700

debhelper (0.84) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied Che_Fox'x patches to example rules files, which makes them use
    an install target internally to move things into place in debian/tmp.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Apr 1998 12:08:45 -0700

debhelper (0.83) unstable; urgency=low

  * Generate symlinks in build stage of debian/rules. cvs cannot create them
    properly. Note that version 0.80 and 0.81 could not build some packages
    because of missing symlinks.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 31 Mar 1998 19:27:29 -0800

debhelper (0.81) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: empty $tomove (#20495).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 31 Mar 1998 15:36:32 -0800

debhelper (0.80) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved under cvs (so I can fork a stable and an unstable version).
  * dh_movefiles: first move real files, then move symlinks. (#18220)
    Thanks to Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com> and Adam Heath 
    <adam.heath@usa.net> for help on the implementation.
  * dh_installchangelogs: use debian/package.changelog files if they exist
    rather than debian/changelog. It appears some people do need per-package
    changelogs.
  * dh_gencontrol: if debian/package.changelogs files exist, use them.
  * Above 2 changes close #20442.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Mar 1998 20:54:26 -0800

debhelper (0.78) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * More spelling fixes from Christian T. Steigies. (I ignored the spelling
    fixes to the changelog, though - too many, and a changelog isn't meant
    to be changed after the fact :-)
  * dh_fixperms: remove execute bits from .la files genrated by libtool.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Mar 1998 12:44:42 -0800

debhelper (0.77) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a nasty bug in dh_makeshlibs when it was called with -V, but with
    no version string after the -V.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Mar 1998 16:08:27 -0800

debhelper (0.76) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * I intended version 0.75 to make it in before the freeze, and it did not.
    This is just to get it into frozen. There are no changes except bug
    fixes.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Mar 1998 12:25:47 -0800

debhelper (0.75) unstable; urgency=low

  * Actually exit if there is an unknown option on the command line (oooops!)
  * Fix .so file conversion to actually work (#19933).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Mar 1998 11:54:58 -0800

debhelper (0.74) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: convert .so links to symlinks at last (#19829).
  * dh_installmanpages.1: documented that no, dh_installmanpages never
    installs symlink man pages from the source package (#19831).
  * dh_installmanpages: minor speedups
  * PROGRAMMING: numerous spelling fixes, thanks to Christian T. Steigies.
    Life is too short for me to spell check my technical documentation, but
    I always welcome corrections!

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Mar 1998 22:09:07 -0800

debhelper (0.73) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.72) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Yann Dirson <ydirson@a2points.com> to add a
    --init-script parameter to dh_installinit. (#19227)
  * Documented this new switch.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Mar 1998 17:12:04 -0800

debhelper (0.71) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: -V flag was broken: if just -V was specified,
    dh_makeshlibs would die. Corrected this.
  * dh_lib: removed warning if the arguments passed to a debhelper command
    do not apply to the main package. It's been long enough so I'm 100% sure
    no packages use the old behavior.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Mar 1998 11:46:59 -0800

debhelper (0.70) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: autoscript(): no longer add the modification date to the
    comments aurrounding debhelper-added code. I don't think this date was
    gaining us anything, so let's remove it and save some disk space.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Mar 1998 21:15:13 -0800

debhelper (0.69) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refer to suidregister (8), not (1). Bug #19149.
  * Removed junk file from debian/ dir.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Mar 1998 13:04:36 -0800

debhelper (0.68) unstable; urgency=low

  * Document that README.debian files are installed as README.Debian (#19089).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Mar 1998 17:48:32 -0800

debhelper (0.67) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added PROGRAMMING document that describes the interface of dh_lib, to
    aid others in writing and understanding debhelper programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Mar 1998 12:45:08 -0800

debhelper (0.66) unstable; urgency=low

  * README, dh_testversion.1, dh_movefiles.1: more doc fixes.
  * dh_movefiles: don't check for package names to see if files are being
    moved from one package back into itself, instead, check tmp dir names.
    If you use this behavior, you should use "dh_testversion 0.66".

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Mar 1998 17:50:29 -0800

debhelper (0.65) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs.1, dh_movefiles.1: clarified documentation for Che.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Mar 1998 17:20:39 -0800

debhelper (0.64) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some junk (a whole old debhelper source tree!) that had gotten
    into the source package by accident.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Feb 1998 20:23:34 -0800

debhelper (0.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some debugging output from dh_installmanpages.
  * du_du: no longer does anything, becuase it has been decided on
    debian-policy that du control files are bad.
  * examples/*: removed dh_du calls.
  * debian/rules: removed dh_du call.
  * Modified dh_gencontrol, dh_makeshlibs, and dh_md5sums to generate files 
    with the correct permissions even if the umask is set to unusual 
    values. (#18283)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Feb 1998 23:34:36 -0800

debhelper (0.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: if the man page filename ends in 'x', install it in
    /usr/X11R6/man/.
  * TODO: expanded descriptions of stuff, in the hope someone else will get
    inspired to implement some of it.
  *  Also added all wishlist bugs to the TODO.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Feb 1998 22:38:53 -0800

debhelper (0.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: Add / to end of egrep -v regexp, fixes it so
    debian/icewm.1 can be found.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Feb 1998 09:09:28 -0800

debhelper (0.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make all files readable and writable by owner
    (policy 3.3.8 paragraph 2).
    Lintian found lots of bugs that will be fixed by this change.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Feb 1998 12:26:13 -0800

debhelper (0.59) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added DH_NO_ACT and --no-act, which make debhelper commands run without
    actually doing anything. (Combine with -v to see what the command would
    have done.) (#17598)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Feb 1998 14:51:08 -0800

debhelper (0.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug #17597 - DH_VERBOSE wasn'talways taking effect.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Jan 1998 17:18:17 -0500

debhelper (0.57) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on perl 5.004 or greater (for Getopt::Long).

debhelper (0.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: Applied patch from Yann Dirson <ydirson@a2points.com>,
    to make it not abort of one of the find's fails.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jan 1998 19:16:48 -0500

debhelper (0.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: delete substvarsfiles probperly again (broken in 0.53). #17077
  * Added call to dh_movefiles, and a commented out call to dh_testversion,
    to some of the sample rules files. #17076

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jan 1998 12:48:43 -0500

debhelper (0.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: no longer call getopt(1) to parse options. I wrote my own
    argument processor in perl.
  * Added long versions of all arguments. TODO: document them.
  * All parameters may now be passed values that include whitespace (ie,
    dh_installinit -u"defaults 10")
  * Now depends on perl (needs Getopt::Long).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jan 1998 15:44:09 -0500

debhelper (0.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: ignore all man pages installed into debian/tmp
    type directories. (#16933)
  * dh_*: set up alternative name for files like debian/dirs; you may now
    use debian/<mainpackage>.dirs too, for consistency. (#16934)
  * dh_installdocs: if a debian/package.copyright file exists, use it in
    preference to debian/copyright, so subpackages with varying copyrights
    are supported. (#16935)
  * Added dh_movefiles, which moves files out of debian/tmp into subpackages.
    (#16932)

debhelper (0.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: compress file belongs in debian/. It was looking in ./
    This has been broken since version 0.30.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Jan 1998 14:08:31 -0500

debhelper (0.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make shared libraries non-executable, in accordance with
    policy. (#16644)
  * dh_makeshlibs: introduced a -V flag, which allows you to specify explicit
    version requirements in the shlibs file.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregister,undocumented}:
    Added a -A flag, which makes any files/directories specified on the
    command line apply to ALL packages acted on.
  * Updated Standards-Version to latest.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jan 1998 16:15:01 -0500

debhelper (0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: added -m parameter, which can force the major number
    of the shared library if it is guessed incorrectly.
  * Added dh_testversion to let your package depend on a certian version of
    debhelper to build.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregieter,undocumented}:
    behavior modification - any files/directories specified on the command
    line now apply to the first package acted on. This may not be the
    first package listed in debian/control, if you use -p to make it act on
    a given package, or -i or -a.
  * If you take advantage of the above new behavior, I suggest you add
    "dh_testversion 0.50" to your debian/rules.
  * Display a warning message in cases where the above behavior is triggered,
    and debhelper's behavior has altered.
  * I have grepped debian's source packages, and I'm quite sure this
    is not going to affect any packages currently in debian.
  * dh_lib: isnative() now caches its return value, which should optimize
    away several more calls to dpkg-parsechangelog.
  * README: explain a way to embed debhelper generated shell script into a
    perl script.
  * dh_installinit: A hack to work around the problem in getopt(1) that
    led to bug report #16229: Any text specified on the command line that is
    not a flag will be presumed to be part of the -u flag. Yuck.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jan 1998 14:36:15 -0500

debhelper (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_du: Fixed hardcoded debian/tmp.
  * This change got lost by accident, redid it: Optimized out most of the
    slowdown caused by using dpkg-parsechangelog - now it's only called by
    2 dh_* programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Dec 1997 20:45:22 -0500

debhelper (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_undocumented: exit with an error message if the man page specified
    does not have a section.

debhelper (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: use dpkg-parsechangelog instead of parsing it by hand. This
    makes a package build slower (by about 30 seconds, on average), so
    I might remove it or optimize it if too many people yell at me. :-)
  * dh_undocumented.1: note that it really links to undocumented.7.gz.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 1997 22:19:39 -0500

debhelper (0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: use prefix, instead of PREFIX, becuase autoconf uses that.
    Also, use `pwd`/debian/tmp, instead of debian/tmp.
  * Always substitute #DEBHELPER# in maintainer scripts, even if it expands
    to nothing, for neatness and to save a few bytes. #15863
  * dh_clean: added -k parameter to not delete debian/files. #15789
  * examples/*: use dh_clean -k in the binary targets of all rules files,
    for safety.

debhelper (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split dh_installdebfiles into 3 programs (dh_installdeb, dh_shlibdeps,
    and dh_gencontrol). dh_installdebfiles still works, but is depricated.
  * Added an examples/rules.indep file.
  * examples/rules.multi: changed dh_du -a to dh_du -i in binary-indep

debhelper (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: don't expand text passed to doit() a second time. This fixes
    #15624, and hopefully doesn't break anything else.
  * A side effect of this (of interest only to the debhelper programmer) is
    that doit() can no longer handle complex commands now. (ie, pipes, `;',
    `&', etc separating multiple commands, or redirection)
  * dh_makeshlibs, dh_md5sums, dh_installdebfiles, dh_du, dh_clean, 
    dh_installdirs: don't pass complex commands to doit().

    of fileutils, install -p will not work (#14680)

debhelper (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Install README.debian as README.Debian (of course,
    README.Debian is installed with the same name..)

    postinst, postrm, etc.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Nov 1997 00:45:53 -0500

debhelper (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmenu.1: menufile is in section 5, not 1.

debhelper (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: added source, diff targets that just print an error.
  * dh_clean: clean up more files - *.orig, *.rej, *.bak, .*.orig, .*.rej, 
    .SUMS, TAGS, and empty files.
  * dh_lib: doit(): use eval on parameters, instead of directly running
    them. This lets me clean up several nasty areas where I had to echo the
    commands once, and then run them seperatly.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Nov 1997 19:48:36 -0500

    specified.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 15:51:22 -0500

debhelper (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: leave permissions on files in /usr/doc/packages/examples
    unchanged.

    (#13990) Thanks, Adrian.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 1997 14:35:30 -0400

debhelper (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed *bad* bug that messed up the names of all
    files installed into DEBIAN/ for multiple binary packages.
  * dh_md5sums: fixed another serious bug if dh_md5sums was used for
    multiple binary packages.
  * If you have made any multiple binary packages using debhelper, you
    should rebuild them with this version.
  * dh_md5sums: show cd commands in verbose mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 1997 14:44:30 -0400

debhelper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_suidregister, interfaces to to the suidmanager package.

debhelper (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sped up some things by removing unnecesary for loops.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior modifcation: if there is a debian/TODO, it is
    named like a debian/changelog file: if the package is a debian native
    package, it is installed as TODO. If the package is not a native package,
    it is installed as TODO.Debian.
  * dh_installdocs: handle debian/README.Debian as well as
    debian/README.debian.
  * Added dh_undocumented program, which can set up undocumented.7 symlinks.
  * Moved dh_installdebfiles to come after dh_fixperms in the example rules
    files. (dh_installdebfiles makes sure it installs things with the proper
    permissions, and this reorganization makes the file a bit more flexable
    in a few situations.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Oct 1997 20:08:05 -0400

debhelper (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of bashisms - this package should work now if /bin/sh is ash.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 21:52:53 -0400

debhelper (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved out of unstable, it still has rough edges and incomplete bits, but
    is ready for general use.
  * Added man pages for all commands.
  * Multiple binary package support.
  * Support for specifying exactly what set of binary packages to act on,
    by group (arch or noarch), and by package name.
  * dh_clean: allow specification of additional files to remove as
    parameters.
  * dh_compress: fixed it to not compress doc/package/copyright
  * dh_installmanpage: allow listing of man pages that should not be 
    auto-installed as parameters.
  * dh_installdebfiles: make sure all installed files have proper ownerships
    and permissions.
  * dh_installdebfiles: only pass ELF files to dpkg-shlibdeps, and pass .so
    files.
  * Added a README.
  * dh_compress: changed behavior - debian/compress script is now run inside
    the package build directory it is to act on.
  * Added dh_lib symlink in debian/ so the debhelper apps used in this
    package's debian/rules always use the most up-to-date db_lib.
  * Changed dh_cleantmp commands in the examples rules files to dh_clean.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Sep 1997 12:26:12 -0400
