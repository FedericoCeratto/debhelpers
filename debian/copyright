Debhelper is written by and copyright 1997-2002 Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>.

Increasinly miniscule parts of the code (and certainly my inspiration from the
whole thing) came from debmake, by Christoph Lameter <clameter@debian.org>.

Some of the dh_md5sums command is from a program by Charles 
Briscoe-Smith <cpb4@ukc.ac.uk>.
