"Debhelper is used to help you build a debian package. The philosophy behind "
"debhelper is to provide a collection of small, simple, and easily understood "
"tools that are used in debian/rules to automate various common aspects of "
"building a package. This means less work for you, the packager.  It also, to "
"some degree means that these tools can be changed if debian policy changes, "
"and packages that use them will require only a rebuild to comply with the "
"new policy."

"A typical debian/rules file that uses debhelper will call several debhelper "
"commands in sequence, or use L<dh(1)> to automate this process. Examples of "

msgstr ""

# type: textblock

"To create a new debian package using debhelper, you can just copy one of the "
"sample rules files and edit it by hand. Or you can try the dh-make package, "
"which contains a L<dh_make|dh_make(1)> command that partially automates the "
"process. For a more gentle introduction, the maint-guide debian package "
"contains a tutorial about making your first package using debhelper."

"Many debhelper commands make use of files in F<debian/> to control what they "
