=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_installwm> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [B<-n>] [B<--priority=>I<n>] [S<I<wm ...>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_installwm is a debhelper program that is responsible for
generating the postinst and postrm commands that register a window manager
with L<update-alternatives(8)>

Any window manager programs specified as parameters will be registered in
the first package dh_installwm is told to act on. By default, this is the
first binary package in debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags,
it will be the first package specified by those flags.

Files named debian/package.wm can list other window manager programs to
register.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--priority=>I<n>

Set the priority of the window manager. Default is 20, which is too low for
most window managers; see the Debian Policy document for instructions on
calculating the correct value.

=item B<-n>, B<--noscripts>

Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts. Turns this command into a no-op.

=item I<wm ...>

The commands used to run the window manager or window managers you want to
register.

=head1 NOTES

Note that this command is not idempotent. "dh_clean -k" should be called
between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
